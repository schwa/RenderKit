## Goals

* Learn from RenderKit & RenderKitClassic
* More type safe
* Async
* Outputs
  * Built-in offscreen renderer
  * Built-in support for MTKView and CAMetalLayer
  * VisionKit 'CPSceneSessionRoleImmersiveSpaceApplication' output
  * (The more outputs the less fragile the APO will be)
* Simpler API for just getting shit on-screen
  * Create a simple render API that takes a single pipeline
* RenderEnvironment variables modelled after SwiftUI.Environment for safety
* Use Function-builder for pipelines/stages etc
* Cleaner render model that more closely matches Metal.
* Built-in support for RenderGraph editor (use NodeEditor)
* Work with multisample, ray tracing
* Figure out how to #include metal headers across packages (likely not possible).
* Get more helper code of RenderKit and into MetalSupport etc
* Use Spatial framework
* Take advantage of Swift macros
* Sort out the various projection APIs
