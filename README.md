# RenderKit3

Yet another Metal Rendering engine experimentâ€¦

## Goals

* Learn from RenderKit & RenderKitClassic
* More type safe
* Async
* Outputs
    * Built in offscreen renderer
    * Built in support for MTKView and CAMetalLayer
    * VisionKit 'CPSceneSessionRoleImmersiveSpaceApplication' output
    * (The more outputs the less fragile the api will be)
* Simpler API for just getting shit on screen
* RenderEnvironment variables modeled after SwiftUI.Environment for safety
* Use Function builder for pipelines/stages etc
* Cleaner render model that more closely matches Metal.
* Built in support for RenderGraph editor (use NodeEditor)
* Work with multisample, ray tracing
